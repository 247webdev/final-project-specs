## FINAL PROJECT DESCRIPTION
For the final project you will use your knowledge of front and
back-end web development to produce an awesome web application that
can be used by friends, family or any of the other billions of people
who use the Internet. The type of web application you create is your
choice.


The objective of this project is:

* To apply knowledge by building a web application from the ground up.
* To demonstrate mastery of topics covered during this course.
* To showcase your abilities to potential employers, friends, family,
and community members.

## CORE REQUIREMENTS
* **Documentation.** README.md contains purpose and description of app
and code is commented.
* **Handles invalid data.** Forms in your application should validate
  data and handle incorrect inputs. Validate sign up information,
  verify valid email addresses and secure passwords.
* **Partials.** Use partials to DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself) up your
views.
* **JavaScript & jQuery.** Spice up the front-end of your app and have
  some event driven functionality. Pick framework(s) and/or library(s)
  to improve your js codebase cleanliness, DRYness, and
  maintanability. If you want to write a JSON API with Rails, and
  build your frontend as a pure JS app, then go for it.
* **AJAX.** Use AJAX to communicate with the server without reloading
  the page. Some things to consider might be validating or saving form
  input.
* **Rails or Node.** You can build your app in Rails or Node (in some cases both)
* **CSS & Styling**
* **Heroku.** Deploy your code to Heroku.

## OPTIONAL ADD-ONS

* **Socket.IO** Incorporate Socket.IO when building your app.
* **Underscore.js** Impress us with your newfound Underscore.js knowledge.
* **Frontend framework** to organize your js code. See [TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com) for ideas.
  * *NOTE:* If you decide to use one of these, you *must* be able to defend your decision, by answering an instructor's questions on Monday about why you think you can a) handle it b) use it effectively, in terms of why you need the framework.
* **Authentication and Authorization.** Your app will maintain user
  accounts and profiles. Login credentials must be validated before
  users can gain access to your application.
* **External APIs.** Use external APIs to add functionality to your
app, if it makes sense to do so.
* **Responsive Design** Use responsive design techniques to make your
  site beautiful on various screen sizes. Consider using Twitter
  Bootstrap or another css framework to help with this.

## PLANNING & DELIVERABLES

Planning:

* **Group members (Optional)** If you want to work in a group, we
  think you’ll learn the most if you work in groups of 2, but you may
  have groups of up to 3. If you plan on having a group of 3, please
  first consult with instructors.
* **Scope.** What features will it have? What do you reasonably think
you can implement in the time period?

Project plan deliverables:

* **Wireframes.** Begin sketching out on paper what a few of your core
pages will look like and how they will work.
* **MVP.** Provide a summary of the project and a list of MVP
features.
* **Milestones.** Outline some milestones for yourself based on how
you prefer to work.

Final project deliverables:

* Link to Heroku hosted project
* Link to source code on GitHub


## TIMELINE

* Thursday, April 2nd at 10:00am - Final project deliverables due

## WHAT WE ARE LOOKING FOR
Make sure that your code is:

* Dynamic
* Flexible/extensible
* Well-commented
* Well-formatted
* Follows naming conventions
* Tested
* Clean

We’ll also be looking at:

* Quality of communication around decision-making. That is, can you
  defend why you chose a certain technology or why you implemented
  your solution in a certain way?
* Your ability to pick up new technologies.
* Your ability to take full advantage of a language’s features.
